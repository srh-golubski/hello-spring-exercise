# hello-spring-exercise

When the user submits the form (via a POST request), they should be greeted in the selected language. Your new feature should:

Include at least 5 languages, with English being the default. If you don’t speak 5 languages yourself, ask your friend the Internet.
Include a new public static method, createMessage, in the HelloController that takes a name as well as a language string. Based on the language string, you’ll display the proper greeting.
